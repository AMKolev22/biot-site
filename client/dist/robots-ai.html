                    <p>What comes to mind when you hear the word “robot”? Do you picture a metallic humanoid in a spaceship in the distant future? Perhaps you imagine a dystopian future where humanity is enslaved by its robot overlords. <br>
                        <br>
                        Or maybe you think of an automobile assembly line with robot-like machines putting cars together. <br>
                        <br>
                        Whatever you think, one thing is sure: robots are here to stay. Fortunately, it seems likely that robots will be more about doing repetitive or dangerous tasks than seizing supreme executive power. Let’s look at robotics and it’s future.</p>
                        <div class="article-information">
                            <h1>The Future of <span class="robotics">Robotics</span> : What’s the Use of AI in <span class="robotics"><br>Robotics</span>?</h1></h1>
                            <p id = "article-text"><span class = "green">Artificial Intelligence</span> (AI) increases human-robot interaction, collaboration opportunities, and quality. The industrial sector already has co-bots, which are robots that work alongside humans to perform testing and assembly. <br>
                                <br>

                                 Advances in AI help robots mimic human behavior more closely, which is why they were created in the first place. <br>
                                 <br>
                                <span class = "green"> Robots that act and think more like people can integrate better into the workforce and bring a level of efficiency unmatched by human employees.</span> <br>
                                <br>
                                Robot designers use Artificial Intelligence to give their creations enhanced capabilities like: <br>
                                <br>
                                - <span class = "green">Computer Vision</span>: Robots can identify and recognize objects they meet, discern details, and learn how to navigate or avoid specific items. <br>
                                <br>
                                - <span class = "green">Manipulation</span>: AI helps robots gain the fine motor skills needed to grasp objects without destroying the item. <br>
                                <br>
                                - <span class = "green">Motion Control and Navigation</span>: Robots no longer need humans to guide them along paths and process flows. AI enables robots to analyze their environment and self-navigate. This capability even applies to the virtual world of software. AI helps robot software processes avoid flow bottlenecks or process exceptions. <br>
                                <br>
                                <span class = "green">Natural Language Processing</span> (NLP) and Real-World Perception: <span class = "green">Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML)</span> help robots better understand their surroundings, recognize and identify patterns, and comprehend data. These improvements increase the robot’s autonomy and decrease reliance on human agents.</p>

                        <div class="article-information" id = "article2"><h1>The Future of <span class = "robotics">Robotics:</span> How <span class = "robotics">robots</span> will change the <br>world</h1>
                            <p id = "article-text">Robots will increase economic growth and productivity and create new career opportunities for many people worldwide. <br>
                                <br>
                                However, there are still warnings out there about massive job losses, <span class = "green">forecasting losses of 20 million manufacturing jobs by 2030, or how 30% of all jobs could be automated by 2030</span>. <br>
                                <br>
                                But thanks to the consistent levels of precision that robots offer, we can look forward to <span class = "green">robots handling more of the burdensome, redundant manual labor tasks, making transportation work more efficiently, improving healthcare, and freeing people to improve themselves</span>.  <br>
                                <br>
                                But, of course, time will tell how this all works out.</p>

                        <div class="article-information" id = "article3"><h1>The Future of <span class = "robotics">Robotics</span> and <span class = "robotics">robots</span></h1>
                            <p id = "article-text">
                                Thanks to <span class = "green">improved sensor technology and more remarkable advances in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, robots will keep moving from mere rote machines to collaborators with cognitive functions.</span><br>
                                <br>
                                These advances, and other associated fields, are enjoying an upwards trajectory, <span class = "green">and robotics will significantly benefit from these strides</span>. <br>
                                <br>
                                We can expect to see more significant numbers of increasingly sophisticated robots incorporated into more areas of life, working with humans. <br>
                                <br>
                                Contrary to dystopian-minded prophets of doom, these improved robots will not replace workers. Industries rise and fall, and some become obsolete in the face of new technologies, <span class = "green">bringing new opportunities for employment and education</span>. That’s the case with <span class = "green">robots</span>.  <br>
                                <br>
                                <span class = "green">Perhaps there will be fewer human workers</span> welding automobile frames, but there will be a greater need for skilled technicians to program, maintain, and repair the machines. In many cases, this means that employees could receive valuable in-house training and upskilling, <span class = "green">giving them a set of skills that could apply to robot programming and maintenance and other fields and industries</span>.</p>
