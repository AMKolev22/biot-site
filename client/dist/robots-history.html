                    <p>Ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Chinese, were captivated by the idea of building mechanical
                        devices that imitated human or animal movements. <br>
                        
                        These early automatons were often powered by
                        simple mechanisms like water, steam, or clockwork.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        One notable example is the "Irrigation Device" invented by the ancient Egyptians around 250 BCE. This automaton used
                        a series of water-filled vessels and valves to simulate a flowing river showcasing their understanding of hydraulics.
                        <br> <br>
                        The Middle Ages witnessed significant progress in the development of mechanical automata. These devices, often
                        found in churches and royal courts, were designed for entertainment and religious purposes.</p>
