                            <h1><span class="robotics">Efficiency and <span class = "green">Productivity</span></h1>

                            <p id = "article-text">Robots are designed to <span class = "green">perform repetitive tasks with precision and accuracy</span>, often at a faster pace than humans. <br><br>
                                This leads to increased efficiency and productivity in various industries, such as manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. 
                               <br><br> By automating routine and mundane tasks, <span class = "green">robots free up human workers to focus on more complex and creative endeavors</span>.
                                <br><br>Robotics has transformed various industries, <span class = "green">leading to significant advancements in technology and innovation</span>. The adoption of industrial robots has led to growth in productivity, particularly in the manufacturing industry, by reducing the need for human assistance in repetitive processes. 
                                <br><br>While the effects of robot adoption have varied by industry, the largest productivity gains were found to be among industries in the early stages of adopting robots. <br><br>However, the adoption of robots has also led to concerns about job displacement and wage reduction, especially for workers in the automotive industry and certain parts of the country.</p>
