                <p class="ancient-civilizations">Ancient civilizations, such as the <span class="civilizations">Egyptians, Greeks, and Chinese, were captivated by the idea of 
                    building mechanical</br> devices</span> that imitated human or animal movements.
                    These early automatons were often powered by</br> simple mechanisms like water, steam, or clockwork.</p>

                    <p class="ancient-civilizations">One notable example is the <span class="civilizations">"Irrigation Device" invented by the ancient Egyptians around 250 BCE.</span> 
                    This automaton used</br> a series of water-filled vessels and valves to simulate a flowing river showcasing their 
                    understanding of hydraulics.</p>

                    <p class="ancient-civilizations">The Middle Ages witnessed significant progress in the development of mechanical automata. These devices, often</br> found in 
                    churches and royal courts, were designed for entertainment and religious purposes.</p>

                    <p class="ancient-civilizations"><span class="civilizations">The "Jacquard Loom," invented by Joseph-Marie Jacquard in the early 19th century</span>, is
                    an example of an early</br> programmable machine. It utilized punch cards to control the weaving of complex patterns, 
                    </br>demonstrating an early form of automation.</p>
