                <p class="ancient-civilizations">Ancient civilizations, such as the <span class="civilizations">Egyptians, Greeks, and Chinese, were captivated by the idea of 
                    building mechanical</br> devices</span> that imitated human or animal movements.
                    These early automatons were often powered by</br> simple mechanisms like water, steam, or clockwork.</p>

                <p class="ancient-civilizations">One notable example is the <span class="civilizations">"Irrigation Device" invented by the ancient Egyptians around 250 BCE.</span> 
                    This automaton used</br> a series of water-filled vessels and valves to simulate a flowing river showcasing their 
                    understanding of hydraulics.</p>

                <p class="ancient-civilizations">The Middle Ages witnessed significant progress in the development of mechanical automata. These devices, often</br> found in 
                    churches and royal courts, were designed for entertainment and religious purposes.</p>

                <p class="ancient-civilizations"><span class="civilizations">The "Jacquard Loom," invented by Joseph-Marie Jacquard in the early 19th century</span>, is
                    an example of an early</br> programmable machine. It utilized punch cards to control the weaving of complex patterns, 
                    </br>demonstrating an early form of automation.</p>

                <p class="early-revolution">The Industrial Revolution, which began in the 18th century in Britain, marked </br>a shift from manual labor to machine-based manufacturing.</p>

                <p class="early-robotics">The rise of factories and mass production created a demand 
                    for automated systems that could perform repetitive </br>tasks more efficiently than human workers.
                    <span class="industrial-revolution">This need for increased productivity and efficiency</span> fueled the </br>development of early robotic devices.</p>

                <p class="early-robotics">The concept of programmable machines emerged during the Industrial Revolution, setting</br>
                    the stage for the early automation of tasks. The development of the <span class="industrial-revolution">Jacquard loom, invented by
                    Joseph-Marie Jacquard </br>in the early 19th century</span>, represented a significant leap forward.</p>

                <p class="early-robotics"><span class="industrial-revolution">These early mechanical robots and programmable machines</span> marked significant
                    milestones in the <span class="industrial-revolution">development of</br> robotics.</span> They demonstrated the potential for 
                    machines to replicate human actions, </br>paving the way for future advancements in the field.</p>

            </br>

                <p class="world-war-robots">The outbreak of <span class="rise-century">World War II</span> brought about an increased demand
                    for automated systems to assist in military operations.</br> 
                    During this time, significant advancements were made in the field of <span class="rise-century">telecommunications, 
                    computing, and control systems,</span></br> laying the foundation for future developments in robotics.<p>

                <p class="world-war-robots">One notable example is the development of the first electronic digital computers,
                    such as the Colossus and ENIAC. These</br> machines were used for code-breaking and complex calculations,
                    demonstrating the potential for electronic devices to process information.</p>

                <p class="world-war-robots">Additionally, <span class="rise-century">the development of guided missile systems and the use of remotely
                    operated vehicles for bomb disposal</span></br>
                    showcased early applications of robotic technology in warfare.</p>

                    <p class="world-war-robots">The concept of artificial intelligence <span class="rise-century">(AI)</span> emerged in the <span class="rise-century">mid-20th century</span>,
                    laying the groundwork for advancements in</br> robotics. Influential figures such as 
                    <span class="rise-century">Alan Turing</span> and <span class="rise-century">John McCarthy</span> played significant
                    roles in the development</br> of AI as a field of study.</p>
